<h1>CSS Preprocessors</h1>

Vite has zero-config support for postcss and sass.

E.g you can setup your postcss.config.js

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
export default ctx => ({
  plugins: {
    "postcss-import": {},
    "postcss-mixins": {},
    // Anything else you want here.
  }
})

```

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default}/>
