# Component Driven Design

So now we can start documenting components.

Document additional stories

```javascript
// card.stories.js

export const Content = {
  args: {
    modifer_class: 'card--content',
    title: 'Drupal South 2024',
    href: '#',
    teaser: 'DrupalSouth is the regional Drupal conference for Australia and New Zealand. Originally started in New Zealand in 2008, the DrupalSouth name was adopted by Australia in 2014 after running as Drupal Downunder and Drupalcon Sydney in earlier years. A separate DrupalGov conference has also been run by DrupalSouth organisers on an intermittent basis. The conference typically attracts 200-400 attendees and features local and international speakers who are selected by a panel of their peers for each event.',
    image_alt: 'Image of Sydney opera house',
    image_uri: "/logo2.png",
  }
};

````

We can add `.mdx` files in the component folders with docs.

## Example
### Default card
Use the default card when Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio, ullam.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Default}/>
<Controls of={CardStories.Default}/>

### Content card
Use the content card when Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio, ullam.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Content}/>
<Controls of={CardStories.Content}/>

## Example

```
import {Meta, Canvas, Controls} from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as CardStories from "../components/card/card.stories.js";

<Meta title="Cards"/>

We can add `.mdx` files in the component folders with docs.

## Example
### Default card
Use the default card when Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio, ullam.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Default}/>
<Controls of={CardStories.default}/>

### Content card
Use the content card when Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio, ullam.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Content}/>

```
